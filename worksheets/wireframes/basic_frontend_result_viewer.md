# Wireframe & Justification

This document should help you explain how your user interfaces are designed. You should have a wireframe to give a good overview and some screenshot with simple writeups to justify your designs.

## Justifications

### Justification 1

#### Good Points

1. The timetable looks very neat as the width of the columns are consistent. 
2. The Day and Time header have a different colour from the content so it is easier for the user to read the table.
3. The name of the table is indicated at the top right above the table which enables the user to know what is the table about. 

#### Bad Points

1. The duration for each period is not consistent(15min, 45min, 1hr), users might be confused easily.
2. Some of the rows can be conjoined together for easier viewing.
3. Different colours can be added for different subjects for better visualization (UI can be improved).
4. Filters can be added so that user is able to view selected data easily and efficiently.

### Justification 2

#### Good Points

1. Timetable has different colours for each period/ event which makes it easier for users to read and the table gets to catch user's attention easily (Good UI).
2. Timetable has the timing of each period/ event written on the top of each note, this makes it easier for users to take note of the duration.

#### Bad Points

1. When events overlap with each other, users will have diffulties reading off the overlapped event/ period.
2.  Description of the event can be put at the side of the table when the user hovers/click on the event so that the table will look more neat and user friendly.
3. The description of the event can be replaced with the title of the events instead. This will help the user to read and understand the timetable in a shorter time.
3. Filters can be added so that user is able to view selected data easily.

### Justification 3

#### Good Points

1. Timetable has different colours for each period/ event which makes it easier for users to read and able to catch user's attention immediately (Good UI).
2. There is an additional tab at the left to give an overview of what has to be done which provides the user a better understanding about the event.
3. Show active date with colors and narrow bars which allows the user to know which date is the user looking at currently (user-friendly).

#### Bad Points

1. The number of days left to complete the task remains the same as the dates pass, it would be better if the number of days left can subtract according to the dates. 
2. Start and end date can be included for each task for easier viewing.
3. Filters can be added so that only the tasks that have to be done on the current date will be shown, for more efficient searching purpose.
