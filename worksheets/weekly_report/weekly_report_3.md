## What have I done last week

-   We did query data. 
-   We have added more data into the database 
-   We have changed the 'lecture' datatypes
-   We managed to change the "startTime" and "endTime" into string so that the output format is correct. 
- Updated the tables 


## What do I plan to do next week

-   Connect database to front end 
-   Do some improvement on front end 

## Additional Thoughts

-  May we ask something about elephantSQL? Is it possible if two person access to the same account for elephantsql so that both of us can have access to it :D
-   If the answer is yes, how can we do it? 
-   Thank you in advance :D
