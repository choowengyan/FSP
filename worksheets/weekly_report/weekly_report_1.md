# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   We have learnt the difference between Git and         Github and tried to explore on Git 
-   We have formed a team and accepeted the               assignment on Git
-   We have tried out how to work together with           groupmate on Git and solved the problems              together (push, pull, commit staged)
-   What have we changed: Names 

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Create wireframe for our assignment 
        (perhaps each of us can create one wireframe and we will combine both of our ideas?)
-   Watch demo videos to have a deeper understanding 

## Additional Thoughts

-   Git is so confusing :(
-   Lecturer's drawing skill is cool!
